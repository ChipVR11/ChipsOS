# ChipsOS
on no circumstances should you EVER download any of the other files on this github page. some are shitty rats that i can no longer spy on people and others delete all of your system files. DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM MY PAGE EXCEPT FOR THIS OS, yeah i was in my edgy hacker/skid era so uh yeah.
ok actual stuff about the os now. ChipsOS is a small text/console based os with a few commands
commands:
sayhello, runs hello world
echo, says what you type
ping_test, a ping command that i'll use later to see if i could possibly get wifi support
os information, shows the version of chips os you are using
help, shows commands
